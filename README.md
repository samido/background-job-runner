# Background Job Runner for Laravel

This project provides a custom system to execute PHP classes as background jobs, independent of Laravel's built-in queue system. It is designed to be scalable, error-handling capable, and easy to use.

Key Features:
- Execute PHP classes and methods as background jobs.
- Supports both Windows and Unix-based systems.
- Includes retry mechanisms, detailed logging, and security validations.
- Optional web-based dashboard for job monitoring.
2. Requirements
List all the prerequisites for running the project.

## Requirements

- PHP >= 8.0 with the following extensions:
  - `pdo_sqlite`
  - `fileinfo`
  - `mbstring`
  - `openssl`
- Composer
- Laravel >= 9.x
- SQLite, MySQL, or other supported database
- A web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) or Laravel's built-in server
- Windows or Unix-based system

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/background-job-runner.git
   cd background-job-runner
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
composer install
Set up your environment:

Copy the example .env file:
bash
Copy code
cp .env.example .env
Configure the database and other environment variables in .env.
Generate the application key:

bash
Copy code
php artisan key:generate
Run database migrations:

bash
Copy code
php artisan migrate
Configure logging channels (optional):

In config/logging.php, ensure background_jobs and background_jobs_errors channels are configured.
(Optional) Configure approved jobs:

Add approved job classes in config/background_jobs.php:
php
Copy code
'approved_jobs' => [
    App\BackgroundJobs\ExampleJob::class,
],
Rebuild autoload:

bash
Copy code
composer dump-autoload
Test the application:

bash
Copy code
php artisan serve
Visit http://localhost:8000 to access the application.

### **4. How to Use**
Explain how to use the job runner.

#### **Run Jobs Using the Helper**
```markdown
## How to Use

### Running a Job Programmatically
Use the `runBackgroundJob` helper to execute a job:

```php
use App\BackgroundJobs\ExampleJob;

runBackgroundJob(ExampleJob::class, 'execute', ['Sample Data']);
Run Jobs Using the Standalone Script
You can also execute jobs from the command line:

bash
Copy code
php scripts/background-job-runner.php App\BackgroundJobs\ExampleJob execute "Sample Data"
ruby
Copy code

#### **Retry Mechanism**
```markdown
### Retry Mechanism
If a job fails, the system will retry up to the configured number of attempts in `config/background_jobs.php`:
```php
'retries' => 3,  // Number of retry attempts
'delay' => 5,    // Delay in seconds between retries
bash
Copy code

#### **Logging**
```markdown
### Logging
- Successful jobs are logged in `storage/logs/background_jobs.log`.
- Failed jobs are logged in `storage/logs/background_jobs_errors.log`.
5. Security
Highlight the security mechanisms in place.

markdown
Copy code
## Security

- Only pre-approved classes can be executed as jobs.
- Class and method names are validated and sanitized.
- Unauthorized or invalid class executions will be logged and blocked.
6. Advanced Features
Explain any advanced features, such as job priority or delays.

markdown
Copy code
## Advanced Features

### Job Delays
You can delay job execution by specifying a delay in the `config/background_jobs.php` file:
```php
'delay' => 10, // Delay in seconds
Job Priority
High-priority jobs can be executed before lower-priority ones by customizing the runner logic in JobRunner.php.

### **7. Troubleshooting**
Provide solutions for common issues.
```markdown
## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Autoload Errors**
   If you encounter errors related to autoloading, ensure:
   - The file paths and namespaces comply with PSR-4.
   - Run:
     ```bash
     composer dump-autoload
     ```

2. **Permission Denied**
   Ensure the `storage` and `vendor` directories have the correct permissions:
   ```bash
   chmod -R 775 storage vendor
Missing Dependencies Ensure required PHP extensions are installed:

bash
Copy code
php -m
Look for pdo_sqlite, mbstring, openssl, and fileinfo.

Job Execution Fails Check the error logs at storage/logs/background_jobs_errors.log.
